### What is BullDawgs-Wiser?

BullDawgs-Wiser is an artifical intelligence (AI) advisement tool meant to aid college students with their schedules and graduation requirements throughout their time in school. It will not only be of use to students but also to advisors. 

### Objective

One of the primary goals in mind when designing this software is for it to be able to save advisors a significant amount of time when it comes to scheduling meetings and analyzing each studentâ€™s progress. Additionally, the tool will be a modular system that can easily be repackaged for other departments and other requirements.
